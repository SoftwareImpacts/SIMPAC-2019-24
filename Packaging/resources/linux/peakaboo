#Newer versions of java (9+) should be passed the --illegal-access=permit flag. This is because
#the Java 9+ module system puts some restrictions on reflection which must be explicitly permitted
#Because Peakaboo makes aggressive use of reflection to store serialized data to avoid a massive
#memory footprint, this needs to be enabled for Peakaboo to function. Java 9 just warns about it
#but some future version of Java will default deny. This would break user's installs, so we set it
#to be permissive now.
#HOWEVER: Older versions of Java (8-) don't know what this flag is, and will wig out if they see it.
#So it isn't as simple as just passing the flag for the versions that support it.
