/**
 * SpectrumList is an implementation of the List interface which writes 
 * out values to a temporary file, rather than storing elements in memory.
 * This is useful for lists which are sufficiently large to cause memory
 * concerns in a typical JVM.
 * <br /><br /> 
 * Storing elements on disk means that get operations will return copies 
 * of the objects in the list rather than the originally stored objects. 
 * If an element is retrieved from the list, modified, and then 
 * retrieved a second time, the second copy retrieved will lack the 
 * modifications made to the first copy.
 * 
 * To create a new SpectrumList, call {@link SpectrumList#create(String)}.
 * If the SpectrumList cannot be created for whatever reason, a memory-based
 * list will be created instead.
 * <br/><br/>
 * Note that this class depends on the specific implementation of Spectrum
 * being {@link ISpectrum}
